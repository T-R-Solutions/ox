# Convergence — design proposal only

AC-01..07: UNVERIFIED. ADR and bounded specification are prepared; no storage code, dependency, migration, fault experiment or backup has been implemented/executed. T001 completion is a documentary result, not product acceptance.

Requirement → decision/risk → task → proposed code boundary/oracle is in traceability.json. Its source/spec paths are explicit placeholders for future executable acceptance, not evidence of implemented functionality. Maintainer owns T002/D1..D4. Exact next step: record explicit authorization and durability/platform/operational bounds, then perform only the explicitly authorized paired experiment. Technology selection follows its results; integration requires a separate grant. Deferral from F0 to an independent pre-MVP delivery is already adopted in the F0 boundary ADR; experiment/engine/integration remain open.

Follow-up: E01..E08 and the results-first decision rule are prepared in the ADR;
T007 is documentary completion. SQLite and snapshots remain UNVERIFIED; no winner,
driver/version, operational default, experimental result or F0 closure is asserted.
Documentary evidence is in product-f0-gate and its decision-preparation review.


## Preparation successor — 2026-11-05

T008 completed documentary preparation in experiment-protocol.md. All product
AC-01..07 remain UNVERIFIED. D1 placement is already adopted; do not ask again.
D2 contract/envelope, D3 experiment grant, D4 operational proposals and D4-deps
freeze review remain pending. D5 selection follows results; D6 integration is
separate. See robustness-20261105/report.md for current source inspection.
