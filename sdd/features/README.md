# Ox SDD feature index

Features remain directly under `sdd/features/`. Each feature owns its requirements,
scope, criteria and evidence. Read its spec, plan, tasks and latest convergence
record before resuming. A directory or completed task list does not establish
acceptance. [Workflow](../workflow.md) defines the local and full routes;
[evidence.md](../evidence.md) defines the five states and content bindings.

## Ox product

| Feature | Scope and current interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| `product-foundation` | Governance transition into implementation; does not implement product engines |
| `product-bootstrap` | Virtual workspace, 16 crates and minimal Iced shell |
| `product-plugin-host` | Local Unix host, protocol negotiation, grants, failures and controlled shutdown |
| `product-agent-runtime` | Direct-child supervision, attempts, events, cancellation and deadline |
| `product-verification-engine` | Local oracle, byte snapshots, history and invalidation in memory |
| `product-local-task-ui` | Controlled task and explicit verification integrated into the desktop |
| `product-f0-gate` | Foundation gate and successive operational observations; final raster-profile successor accepts the adopted local corpus |
| `product-local-persistence` | Proposed independent delivery after F0 and before F3/MVP; implementation awaits authorization |

F0's current report at `docs/validation/f0-resumption-20261103/report.md`
supersedes earlier open conclusions only for the identified inputs and corpus.
It does not authorize F1 or persistence implementation. Real agents, full engines,
SDK and distribution remain future scopes. See the
`application/README.md` and
`docs/architecture/application.md` for the current implementation.

Product paths above are repository-root references. Product implementation and
operational records are excluded from the governance-only export, so this portable
index lists their names without requiring them as link targets.

## Governance and library

| Feature | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [adoption-governance](adoption-governance/spec.md) | Historical adoption of the library and authorities |
| [governance-externalization](governance-externalization/spec.md) | Historical removal of external-study dependencies |
| [governance-layout](governance-layout/spec.md) | Governance tools/configuration layout; application placement subsequently adopted in the bootstrap ADR |
| [maintenance-001](maintenance-001/spec.md) | Preservation, recovery and sharing |
| [governance-reconciliation](governance-reconciliation/spec.md) | Reconcile active governance with historical preservation |
| [technical-acceptance](technical-acceptance/spec.md) | Criterion and evidence semantics |
| [skill-ui-metadata-inventory](skill-ui-metadata-inventory/spec.md) | Skill metadata inventory |
| [skill-consumer-validation](skill-consumer-validation/converge.md) | Executable bounded consumers for nine specializations; independent from product acceptance |
| [readme-skill-integration](readme-skill-integration/converge.md) | README method import and governance integration; README preservation repair recorded separately |
| [technical-documentation-visuals](technical-documentation-visuals/spec.md) | Source-grounded documentation and visual authoring method |

The nine `skill-*` features cover authoring, routing and evaluation of library
specializations. Their methods are indexed in the [bridge catalog](../chain/README.md).
Their technical criteria and consumer observations do not approve product modules.

Historical results retain their original bytes and scope. Changed inputs require
new observations or an explicit undecided state, not renewed historical hashes.
Do not move features to evade checks. Documentation maintenance follows the local
route when contracts and authorization remain unchanged.
