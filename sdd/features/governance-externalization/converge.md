# Current convergence — governance-externalization

Historical observations remain intact in docs/validation/bootstrap-governance/previous.
Changed bootstrap inputs invalidate only the criteria below; this does not demonstrate a regression.

| Criterion | Current state |
|---|---|
| AC-01 | UNVERIFIED |
| AC-02 | UNVERIFIED |
| AC-03 | UNVERIFIED |
| AC-04 | UNVERIFIED |
| AC-05 | UNVERIFIED |
| AC-06 | UNVERIFIED |
| AC-07 | UNVERIFIED |

Resume by reexamining dependent criteria with their own oracles. General bootstrap tests do not reaccept these features.

## Reconciliation follow-up — 2026-10-29

Current profile/recovery/package corrections are governed by
`sdd/features/governance-reconciliation/` and its ADR. Original observations and
these feature-wide pending states remain historical/pending, not automatically
approved by a new Python run. Recovery and distribution observations for the
changed inputs are recorded in docs/validation/governance-reconciliation/.

## Current review — 2026-11-01

Earlier tables are historical. Current observations:

- AC-01: INCONCLUSIVE — Independent-copy tests ran in the complete suite; current actual delivery boundary needs separate qualification.
- AC-02: INCONCLUSIVE — Recursive inspection and mutation suite pass; criterion-specific renamed-content case mapping remains incomplete.
- AC-03: INCONCLUSIVE — Local authority IDs and links pass; semantic correspondence review remains incomplete.
- AC-04: INCONCLUSIVE — Mutation tests pass; the exact required corruption/restoration cases need criterion-specific mapping.
- AC-05: INCONCLUSIVE — Predecessors exist and freshness passes; full history lineage review remains incomplete.
- AC-06: INCONCLUSIVE — Literal 36 UNVERIFIED condition conflicts with later consumer acceptance; technical-acceptance explicitly supersedes product-foundation AC-03, so succession scope here needs reconciliation.
- AC-07: UNVERIFIED — No new actual ZIP was qualified in this consolidation.

## Documentary successor — 2026-11-01

Current documentary reconciliation: docs/validation/f0-reconciliation-20261101/legacy-succession.md. The preceding 25-criterion review remains the inherited baseline (21 INCONCLUSIVE/four UNVERIFIED overall); this is not an independent audit. Only changed documentation dependencies are reexamined. No legacy criterion is promoted by this note. Historical 36-pending wording is no longer a statement of current consumer status; the remaining succession-scope question is explicit.
