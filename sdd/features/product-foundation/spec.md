# Ox product foundation — phase transition

Actor: maintainer and authorized agents. Request: examine and implement transition
plan v1.0, correcting its SDD integration where necessary.
Feature scope: development contract, SDD-integrated library,
checkers and governance distribution. Does not deliver crates or an application.

- REQ-01: Record phase and scope in the context authority, preserving effective permissions.
- REQ-02: Keep AGENTS as the entry point and integrate capabilities with SDD without duplicating policies in skills.
- REQ-03: Separate product acceptance, skill authoring and historical observations.
- REQ-04: Identify and qualify distribution exclusively as governance.
- REQ-05: Preserve a recoverable baseline and reexamine evidence dependent on changed inputs.
- AC-01 → REQ-01: Context records implementation-foundation and not-yet-implemented; authorities allow bounded development and do not grant unrestricted execution.
- AC-02 → REQ-02: AGENTS refers to authorities; the integration guide distinguishes selection, consultation and use, local/full routes and bridge contributions; 29 skills, 29 bridges and SDD 1.3.0 remain intact.
- AC-03 → REQ-03: product-foundation has its own criteria; the skills' 36 technical scenarios remain UNVERIFIED and mutations promoting them are rejected.
- AC-04 → REQ-04: ZIP ox-governance.zip and receipts declare governance without the product; the manifest excludes Cargo/crates and independent extraction passes the five qualification commands.
- AC-05 → REQ-05: Checks and adversarial tests pass; immutable history and baseline retain their bytes; affected observations are archived and replaced by new review/execution with schema 2 and current inputs.

Reject: application approval based on documentation, updating hashes to
recycle old results, changes to POL-01..10, installation/publication based on
a roadmap mention. The local route remains available according to sdd/workflow.md.
Textual gates detect representative regressions without proving the semantics of
arbitrary paraphrases. This feature accepts only the transition.

## Current applicability note — 2026-11-01

The literal requirement to keep all 36 skill scenarios UNVERIFIED records the preparatory baseline, not their current observed state. docs/decisions/technical-acceptance.md explicitly supersedes product-foundation AC-03 and the transition decision; skill-consumer-validation records the successor executions. Its named supersession does not expressly enumerate governance-externalization AC-06, governance-layout AC-04 or maintenance-001 AC-04. Those compound legacy gates remain INCONCLUSIVE pending maintainer confirmation of succession scope and any remaining preservation/qualification evidence. No original scenario, historical result or other clause is waived. Current consumer acceptance never transfers to the product. See docs/validation/f0-reconciliation-20261101/legacy-succession.md.
