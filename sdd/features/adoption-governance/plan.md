# Adoption plan — full route

Record preceding the copying/adaptation of authored content. Full route because
of contracts, governance, independent consumers and integrity. The initial baseline
has already been captured; no preexisting changes will be overwritten.

| ID | Requirements | Decision / risk | Alternative and cost | Reevaluate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-01 | REQ-01 | Complete copies and local snapshots with SHA-256 | References to the external library would break portability | Upstream update |
| D-02 | REQ-02 | 20 existing and 9 new; authoring starts with PLUG, AGENT, VERIFY | Duplicating absorbed capabilities increases ambiguity | Actual selection evaluation |
| D-03 | REQ-03 | Single constitution in docs; sdd/constitution.md points to the authority | Two competing policies would drift | Authorized policy change |
| D-04 | REQ-04 | Stdlib checks and controlled cases; future integration kept separate | Implementing the product would exceed the request | Product availability |
| R-01 | REQ-01 | Writing outside the root or losing provenance | Compare local resource baseline; studies removed by the governance-externalization ADR | Any divergence |
| R-02 | REQ-02 | Vague or overlapping new skills | Concrete references and positive/negative prompts | Observed failure |
| R-03 | REQ-03 | Proposal promoted to decision; false approval | Normative map and convergence per AC | Contract change |
| R-04 | REQ-04 | Oracle tests only wording or confuses simulation and product | Validator mutation tests and bounded evaluation | Insufficient evidence |

Primary capability consulted: the environment's skill-creator, version not declared.
Historical source content is preserved in docs/validation/governance-externalization/historical-authoring.tar.gz;
no Ox bridge or installation. Question: how to author reusable capabilities with
precise selection and progressive references? Deliverable: nine entries, references
and cases. Inspecting library entries supports comparison and does not claim use
of all of them. New skills were not consulted during their own authoring. Supporting
skills were not selected automatically.

Order: baseline and contracts; PLUG → AGENT → VERIFY; workspace and Iced;
context → graph; output and accounting on event contracts. This dependency guides
authoring without imposing runtime libraries.

Current revision: criteria replaced by the governance-externalization ADR. The
historical plan above describes initial authoring; new acceptance uses local inputs
and new evidence. Current capabilities and migration risks are recorded in the
governance-externalization feature plan.
