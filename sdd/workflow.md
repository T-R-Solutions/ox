# Execution and resumption in Codex

Read the project context and applicable instructions before acting. Authorization
comes from the request and environment, not this workflow. Proceed autonomously
with authorized reversible local actions; ask only about material ambiguity,
conflict or actions requiring authorization. Do not request routine approval
between every document.

## Choose the route

Use the **local route** when the goal and acceptance are clear, the affected surface
and consumers are known, and the change is authorized and recoverable, without
material uncertainty about contracts, permissions, integrity, concurrency or operation.
Examples: a text correction or local repair that preserves a known contract.

1. Inspect instructions, existing changes, the contract/callers and relevant checks.
2. Implement the bounded change and run focused verification supporting the result.
3. Fix failures caused by the change and report results, observations and material
   limitations. Record the goal, observed files/versions and check in an artifact
   already used by the project (issue, review or note); do not create spec/plan/tasks
   merely to populate directories.

Use or expand to the **full workflow below** when there is an unresolved material
decision, a contract/authorization change, persisted data, concurrency, consumers
on different versions, uncertain recovery or operational scope requiring coordination.
A one-line change may require this route. Extensive documentation may remain local.
When a new risk appears, preserve completed work, add necessary criteria/decisions/tasks
and continue; do not restart verified work or reduce acceptance to fit the route.

If a change affects an existing feature, update its affected artifacts and evidence,
even on the local route. Do not hide a feature from checks by moving its directory.
Keep the five states and compare current inputs with observed inputs according to
[evidence.md](evidence.md). A small task ends only when applicable criteria are
supported or material gaps are explicit; missing tooling does not imply approval.

Bridges map the full workflow. On the local route, a skill can address a concrete
question independently, without installing a bridge or creating a plan. On either
route, do not load specialists merely because they are mentioned.
[Checks by route](evidence.md#checks-by-route) explains automation limits without
changing its gates.

## Constitution → specify

Identify the authoritative constitution. Inspect the actual state and existing
contracts. Write or adjust the spec with actors, invariants, normal and rejected
scenarios, identifiable criteria and limits. Distinguish requirements from assumptions
or examples. Clarify gaps that prevent decisions; proceed with independent work.

## Plan

Compare proportionate alternatives and record decisions/risks and their requirements.
Consult only bridges present in this SDD's `chain/` directory that match the affected
surface and risk. Confirm that the configured path exists and the skill name matches.
Read the actual entry; choose one primary skill and supporting skills only for
unresolved questions. Record bridge/version, path and reason in the plan; do not
import the catalog.

A missing skill or supporting capability has not been executed. Record the gap and
continue independent work. If the capability is indispensable to acceptance, keep
that criterion unverified and request the necessary information/capability. Never
install, pretend to use or recursively traverse a skill chain merely by reference.

## Tasks → implement

Break changes and checks into IDs, dependencies, files and completion conditions.
Check consistency among the spec, decisions and tasks before implementation.
Use a checklist only when it helps assess requirement quality; checking a box does
not prove code execution. Confirm commands in the project. Keep `tasks.md` files
in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR); other SDD prose is in English.

Apply the selected skill's procedure, if any. Use references only when needed.
Keep product policies in their authoritative documents. Record changes, failures
and checks actually observed; do not hide failing tests by silently changing requirements.

## Converge and resume

Trace requirement → decision/risk → task → change → evidence → acceptance.
Record the five states defined in evidence.md. If an executable gap remains, add a
bounded task and repeat affected checks. If blocked, record the dependency, impact
and exact resumption step. Do not repeat identical attempts without new information
or declare completion because context or budget has ended.

When resuming, read the spec, plan, tasks and latest convergence record; compare
them with current files. Do not rely on hidden chat state or repeat already verified
work. Update evidence affected by code changes. Completion depends on applicable
criteria, not the existence of directories or number of documents.
