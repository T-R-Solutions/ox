# Instrumentation and evidence-led diagnosis

## Select and do not select

Select only when the feature has a concrete instrumentation or evidence-led diagnosis question and this skill
is available at the configured path. Do not select for a mechanical/cosmetic change
without that risk, or merely because another selected bridge mentions this one.
Read the skill's actual activation boundaries; choose one primary skill and auxiliaries
only for unresolved questions. No recursive activation or dependency installation.

## Inputs and contributions

Supply requirement/criterion, decision, risk and task IDs, authorized scope, operational question, symptom/window/cohort, topology, telemetry versions and access constraints.
Keep unknowns explicit and preserve the destination project's authorities.

| Artifact | Contribution |
| --- | --- |
| Constitution | Reconcile existing principles, security/data and operational constraints; introduce no product policy or fixed target. |
| Spec | Identify observable outcomes and diagnostic questions; no invented SLOs. |
| Plan / ADR | Connect requirement → decision/risk IDs to question/signal mapping, hypotheses, discriminating observations and telemetry costs/risks. |
| Tasks | Name bounded work, actual inputs/tools, stop conditions and expected evidence: instrumentation/probe changes, propagation, export-failure and alert/runbook checks. |
| Evidence / convergence | Return criterion/task IDs, environment, observation and limitations: sanitized observations, loss/sampling limits, rejected hypotheses and supported conclusions. |

## Conditional handoff

Consult performance-engineering for unresolved quantitative cost attribution or reliability-engineering for recovery policy only when available and needed. Supply IDs, observations, constraints
and existing permission scope. Absence is an explicit gap, not a completed consultation.
The bridge maps contributions; the skill owns its technical procedure.

## Completion and authority

Use the destination SDD's outcome vocabulary for every applicable criterion; distinguish
observed results from pending or inconclusive checks. Preserve requirement → decision/
risk → task → evidence traceability. Spec owns requirements, plan/ADRs own decisions,
tasks own executable work and evidence/convergence owns the supported result.
This bridge grants no deployment, data access, external messaging or spending authority.
