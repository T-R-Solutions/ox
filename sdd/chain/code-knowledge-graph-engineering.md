# SDD bridge: code-knowledge-graph-engineering

Copy this file to the destination project's `sdd/chain/` and set `skill_path` to the actual project-relative path of the skill entry. This is an optional bridge and does not install or activate the skill.

## Selection

Use for: Node/edge schema, provenance, impact analysis, paths, clusters and subgraph/density visualization.

Do not select for: Do not select for a marketing graph or static presentation; use design-system/design-review. Do not replace a compiler/LSP with embeddings.

Select only when the concrete feature has this specialized question. Read the actual skill; record its path/version and selection reason in the plan. A bridge reference does not recursively select other skills.

## Inputs and contributions

Known inputs: stable identities, extracted/inferred relationships, snapshots, impact queries, cardinality and layout limits. Do not infer missing capabilities or permissions.

| Artifact | Required input / contribution |
|---|---|
| Constitution | Reconcile existing authorization, data residency, safety and project constraints; add no product policy automatically. |
| Spec | Define scoped, observable behavior and rejected cases. Nodes/edges have types, identity and provenance bound to the snapshot. |
| Plan / ADR | Compare alternatives, contract versions and failure modes; link REQ, AC, D and R IDs; preserve authority boundaries. Typed node/edge model with stable IDs and a per-snapshot source of truth. |
| Tasks | Name actual files, fixtures, tools, real permissions, failure injections and completion checks. Test incremental invalidation and distinguish inferences. |
| Evidence / convergence | Identify observed implementation/oracle/configuration versions and hashes, test results, unsatisfied criteria and explicit limits. versioned graph contract, bounded queries, edge traceability, invalidation policies, structural/dense modes |

## Conditional handoff

Optional specialist: `code-context-engineering`. Specific unresolved question: “Can the edge's origin be verified in the indexed code snapshot?” Consult only if actually present and needed. Supply relevant IDs, known facts, unknowns, permission scope, versions and required evidence. Do not install or load a whole dependency chain. Continue independent work and mark blocked criteria unverified.

## Completion and authority

Use the destination SDD's states: APPROVED, REJECTED, UNVERIFIED, INCONCLUSIVE, NOT APPLICABLE (with justification). A mock or document is not execution evidence. Record freshness of inputs and source of each observation. Spec owns behavior; plan/ADRs own decisions; tasks own work; this bridge only connects the skill to those artifacts.
